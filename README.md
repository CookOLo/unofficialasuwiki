# Unofficial ASU Wiki
An unofficial wiki for student life at ASU.

[Click here to go the actual website!](https://unofficialasuwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page)

## Objective
I wanted to archive and document student life at ASU. From student-led events, organizations, start-ups, bands, and etc., I wanted to document it all to preserve this section of ASU history that is often forgotten. All information documented on this wiki are publically sourced (with references included too)!
